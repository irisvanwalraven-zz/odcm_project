# <span style="color:blue">Scraping data from Coolblue</span>

For the course Online Data Collection & Management at Tilburg University, our team aims to scrape data from the Coolblue website. Coolblue is a Dutch ecommerce company. However, Coolblue claims they are more than just an ecommerce company, she builds end-to-end solutions for her customers. They are active in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, both online and in her 15 physical stores. 

In this scraper we scrape Coolblue's Choice. This indicates the best products for Coolblue's consumers, according to other consumers and experts. The products in this category are hardly ever returned, and have the best reviews. A list of these products can be found [here](https://www.coolblue.nl/en/coolblues-keuze). The names, prices, and "reviews" (number of stars) of these products are scraped. 

Coolblue's Choice (or in Dutch, Coolblue's Keuze) is unique and very customer-oriented. It makes the choice to buy a certain product easier and more accessible. For example, your washing machine broke down and you immediately need a new one. You do not have the time to check out all the reviews. Go to Coolblue's website and you can easily find a few washing machines with a Coolblue's Choice logo on it.

In this notebook we will discuss the scraping in three chapters:
1. The preparation before scraping
2. The Coolblue.nl/en/coolblues-keuze scraper
3. Saving the scraped data in a csv file
